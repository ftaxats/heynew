## Introduction
Welcome to Mailto Live. We value the privacy of our users and have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Gmail client app. This policy provides details about the data we handle and how we handle it.

## What Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
To use Mailto Live, you may provide us with certain information necessary to access and utilize the Gmail client app, including:

- Email address: This is required to connect to your Gmail account.
- Other information: You may optionally provide other information to enhance your experience, such as your name or preferences.

### Automated Information Collection
When you use our Gmail client app, we automatically collect information about the emails you send and receive, including:

- Sender email address: The email address of the person sending the email.
- Recipient email addresses: The email addresses of the recipients of the email.
- Subject line: The subject of the email.
- Email body: The content of the email, including text, images, and attachments.
- Timestamps: Dates and times associated with sending and receiving emails.

## How We Use Information
We use the information collected for the following purposes:

- Processing Emails: When using the AI features, we send your email data to OpenAI or Anthropic (AWS Bedrock) to generate responses and provide other AI-powered assistance.
- Storing Planned Responses: We store the AI-generated responses within our system to help you manage your email communications. We do not store the original emails themselves.
- Google Workspace APIs: We use Google Workspace APIs solely to enable the core functionality of our Gmail client app, such as accessing your Gmail account to send and receive emails. We do not use data obtained through Google Workspace APIs to develop, improve, or train generalized AI or ML models.

## How We Share Information
We may share information with the following third parties:

- OpenAI: We utilize OpenAI's API for AI processing of email content. You can find their privacy policy at [https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As per OpenAI's data usage policies, they do not use data submitted via their API to train or improve their models. Data sent through the API is retained for abuse and misuse monitoring for a maximum of 30 days, after which it is deleted (unless required by law).
- Anthropic (AWS Bedrock): We use Anthropic's services for AI processing. Their privacy policy is available at [insert link to Anthropic/AWS Bedrock privacy policy].
- PostHog: We use PostHog for product analytics to understand how users interact with our app and improve its functionality. Their privacy policy can be found at [insert link to PostHog privacy policy].

We only share the minimum necessary data with these third parties and ensure they have appropriate data protection measures in place.

## Data Retention and Deletion

We store your personal information for a period of time that is consistent with our business purposes. We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

We store user data as long as they are using our platform. Once your account is deleted, we automatically delete your data.

When the data retention period expires for a given type of data, we will delete or destroy it.

You may request for your data to be deleted at any point in time by contacting us at info@mailto.live. Upon receiving your request, we will process it within 30 days and confirm once your data has been deleted from our systems.

## Data Security
We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information, including encryption and access controls. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Gmail client app allows you to send and receive emails that may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services. These links are included in the emails by the senders and are not controlled or monitored by us. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites linked in the emails.

When you access these third-party websites through links in your emails, you do so at your own risk. These sites may have their own privacy policies and terms of use, which we encourage you to review before engaging with the site. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites linked in your emails, and we cannot control or assume responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these sites.

## Children's Privacy
Our Gmail client app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take appropriate steps to remove that information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
